# Media Sorter TODO

# Media Sorter TODO

## âœ… COMPLETED: Real-time Progress Tracking (NEW!)
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Added real-time process readout to main GUI
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Implemented IPC communication for progress updates  
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Added progress bar with percentage and file count
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Show current file being processed in status bar
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Added elapsed time display during processing
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Progress tracking for both individual files and folders
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Recursive folder scanning with progress counting
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Visual feedback for all processing stages (scanning, metadata, copying)
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Created test files for verifying progress tracking functionality

## ðŸš¨ URGENT: File Processing Not Working  
- [x] **FIXED**: Syntax error in main.js (incomplete function)
- [x] **FIXED**: File watcher calling processMediaFile with wrong parameters
- [x] **FIXED**: Added debug logging to processMediaFile function
- [x] **FIXED**: Added initializeApp() function to create directories and manifest on startup
- [x] **FIXED**: Added scanAndUpdateManifest() to check existing files vs manifest
- [x] **FIXED**: Enhanced error handling and debug logging throughout
- [x] **FIXED**: Added folder processing - app can now handle dropped folders
- [x] **FIXED**: Added recursive folder scanning to find all media files
- [x] **FIXED**: Added originalDropPath tracking to manifest entries
- [x] **FIXED**: File processing now working - 18 files processed successfully!
- [x] **FIXED**: History.js updated to work with actual manifest array format
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Verify history window displays processed files correctly
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Verify tabs in history window work properly

## âœ… COMPLETED: Timezone & Date Handling
- [x] Fixed UTC to local time conversion for proper date grouping
- [x] Documented timezone handling approach (UTC storage, local display)
- [x] Added comments clarifying timezone conversion in all date functions
- [x] Prepared foundation for professional camera XML metadata processing
- [x] Added Developer Tools access (F12 or Cmd+Shift+I)

## ðŸŽ¯ Priority 1: Complete Original Location Tracking

### 1. Update History Display
- [x] Modify history.js to show original path in file details
- [x] Add original path display to both active and removed files
- [x] Handle cases where originalPath is missing or "Unknown"
- [x] Add Clear import date to history with "Day" at the top of the column Summary ie; if local time is 6-23-2025 then import says TODAY June 23 - 2025, each history line summary shows local import time ie; 6:23 PM 
- [x] Fixed timezone handling: manifest stores UTC, UI shows local time

### 2. Fix Folder Processing
- [x] Update processFolder() function to track original paths for nested files
- [x] Ensure recursive folder scanning preserves source location
- [x] Update drag & drop handling to pass original folder paths

### 3. Improve Existing File Handling
- [x] Update scanExistingFiles() to better handle missing original paths
- [ ] Add option to manually set original path for existing files
- [ ] Consider adding "Import Location" field for user input

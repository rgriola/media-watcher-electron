# Progress Tracking Feature Documentation

## Overview
The Media Watcher app now includes real-time progress tracking that shows users exactly what the app is doing as it processes media files and folders.

## Features

### Visual Progress Display
- **Progress Bar**: Shows percentage completion with smooth animations
- **File Counter**: Displays "X/Y files" to show progress through the batch
- **Current File**: Shows the name of the file currently being processed
- **Elapsed Time**: Real-time timer showing how long processing has been running
- **Operation Status**: Clear descriptions of what the app is currently doing

### Processing Stages Tracked
1. **üì• Starting processing** - Initial setup and file counting
2. **üìÅ Scanning folder** - When processing dropped folders  
3. **üìÑ Processing file** - Individual file handling
4. **üîç Reading metadata** - Extracting video/image/audio metadata
5. **üìÅ Copying file** - Moving file to sorted location
6. **‚úÖ File completed** - Individual file processing finished
7. **‚úÖ Completed processing** - All files finished with timing summary

### Technical Implementation

#### IPC Communication
- New `progress-update` IPC channel sends real-time updates from main process to renderer
- Progress data includes: `isProcessing`, `currentFile`, `processedCount`, `totalCount`, `currentOperation`, `startTime`

#### File Counting
- App pre-scans folders to count total media files before processing
- Provides accurate progress percentages even for deeply nested folders
- Recursive counting supports complex folder structures

#### UI Components
- Status bar at top of main window shows progress information
- Progress bar with CSS animations and color gradients
- Responsive design adapts to different operation types
- Activity log shows major milestones and completion summaries

## Usage
1. **Drop Files**: Individual files show immediate processing feedback
2. **Drop Folders**: App scans folder first, then shows progress through all media files
3. **Mixed Drops**: Multiple files/folders are processed sequentially with combined progress

## Testing
Use the included `test-progress.js` script to create sample files:
```bash
node test-progress.js
```
Then drag the created `test-files` folder to the app to see progress tracking in action.

## Benefits
- **User Confidence**: Users can see the app is working, especially important for large batches
- **Time Estimation**: Elapsed time helps users plan their workflow
- **Error Visibility**: Failed files are clearly indicated without stopping overall progress
- **Professional Feel**: Real-time feedback makes the app feel responsive and polished
